      <p class="aboutme-p">Hello! My name is Allison Livingston and I am a recent graduate from Galvanize's Web Development Immersive program in Denver. I grew up in San Diego, went to college in upstate New York, and lived in Maryland for about 5 years prior to moving to Denver. I spent the last 3.5 years traveling throughout the United States as a Quality Auditor in the construction industry, which gave me the opportunity to explore tons of new cities and national parks. Aside from traveling, I enjoy hiking, trying new breweries, seeing movies, and hanging out with my cats, Chloe and Emma.</p>
